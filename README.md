# Sensitivity Matcher

This is a script that lets you transfer your mouse sensitivity between any 3D games with no calculation required.

Run the script, then:

1) Select the preset/game that you are coming from.
2) Input your sensitivity value from your old game.
3) In your new game, adjust its sens until the test matches.

Press `Alt+[` to perform one full revolution.

Press `Alt+]` to perform multiple full revolutions.

Press `Alt+\` to halt.

The script can also be used to accurately measure any base yaw, by observing gradual drifts over many cycles. Because angle residuals are handled by a floating point accumulator, the measurement is accurate to 16 significant digits.

This eliminates the need to trust paywalled calculators that may or may not have accurate numbers, as most only uses one rotation in their test for a number approximated by integer counts.
