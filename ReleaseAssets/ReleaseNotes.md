_New Feature: Physical stats calculator_
- Enter your mouse CPI to calculate your [physical sensitivity](https://liquipedia.net/counterstrike/Mouse_settings#Sensitivity), or enter physical metric to find corresponding virtual sens.
- **Curvature** in **MPI** and **deg/mm**. (universal, linear scale of physical sensitivity)
- **Circumference** (physical length of a turn, reciprocal scale of physical sensitivity) in **cm/rev** and **in/rev**.
