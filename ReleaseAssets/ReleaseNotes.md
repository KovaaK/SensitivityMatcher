## Release Highlights

[version 1.5]

_New Feature: Rawinput recording (Measurement Mode only)_

* In Measurement Mode, you can now speed up the initial setup of upper and lower bounds estimates by capturing your mouse turn via the Record feature (default hotkey is `[Alt][/]` to toggle recording). 
* Make a rotation in-game with slight over- or undershoots, then confirm them as lower/upper limits using the hotkeys or the new GUI buttons. This gets you straight to the fine-tuning stage of the Turn-Repeater function.

_Enhancement: Convergence Log window during Measurement Mode_

* Graphically show the convergence progress of your Turn-Capture function.
* Added buttons for the Estimate-tuning for those who prefer clicking instead of hotkeys.
* Added button to display the convergence history.

_Usability Change: Default hotkeys of some commands have been changed_
* Turn once: `Alt+[` --> `Alt+'` (single quote)
* Turn a lot: `Alt+]` --> `Alt+;`
* Jog left: `Alt+;` --> `Alt+<`
* Jog right: `Alt+'` --> `Alt+>`

## Changelog

_New: changed default hotkeys for tuning and jogging counts. See helptext._ \
_New: script will make distinct beeps when activating/deactivating rawinput recording with hotkeys. Activating with GUI button will show a confirmation dialog instead._
