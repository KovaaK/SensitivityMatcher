## Release Notes

[version 1.2] 

_New Feature: Custom keybind and yaw .ini files_

Customize your own keybind and yaw list by editing the corresponding .ini files located in the executable's directory. Or, enter a custom yaw value and select "Save current yaw" to save to the list. This gives an easy way to save the results from the Measurement functionality introduced in the last version. The two Fornite presets are moved out of hardcoded list into the default .ini file to improve modularity.
