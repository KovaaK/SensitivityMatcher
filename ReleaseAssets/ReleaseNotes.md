## Release Notes

[version 1.3] 

_New Feature: Custom keybind and yaw .ini files_
- Loads custom yaw list and keybinds from respective .ini files placed in executable directory.
- Select "Save current yaw" from dropdown to save currently-entered yaw value to list.
- Moved two Fornite presets to .ini file.

_New Feature: Physical stats calculator_
- Enter your mouse CPI to calculate your [physical sensitivity](https://liquipedia.net/counterstrike/Mouse_settings#Sensitivity), or enter physical metric to find corresponding virtual sens.
- **Curvature** in **MPI** and **deg/mm**. (universal, linear scale of physical sensitivity)
- **Circumference** in **cm/rev** and **in/rev**. (physical length of a turn, reciprocal scale of physical sensitivity)

_Bug Fix: Measurement Mode autopartition now normalizes when changing partition limit rather than set straight to cap._ \
_Tweak: During Measurement Mode you can select "Swap sens & yaw" from dropdown so you don't need to copy&paste to save._
