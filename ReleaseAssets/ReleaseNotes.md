## Release Highlights

[version 1.5]

_New Feature: Rawinput recording_

* In Measurement Mode, you can now speed up the initial setup of upper and lower bounds estimates by capturing you mouse turn via the Record feature (default hotkey is `[Alt][/]` to toggle recording). Make a rotation in-game with slight over- or undershoots, then confirming them as lower/upper limits using the hotkeys or the new GUI buttons. This gets you straight to the fine-tuning stage with the turn-repeater function.

_Enhancement: Convergence Log window & Bound adjustment buttons_

* Point 1
* Point 2
