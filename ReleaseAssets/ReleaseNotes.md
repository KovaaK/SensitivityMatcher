## Release Notes

[version 1.2] 

_New Feature: Custom keybind and yaw .ini files_

Customize your own keybind and yaw list by editing the corresponding .ini files located at the executable's directory. Or, enter a custom yaw value and select "Save current yaw" to add to list. This provides an easy way to save results from the Measurement functionality introduced last patch. The two Fornite presets are moved out of hardcoded list into the default .ini file to improve modularity.
