## Release Highlights

[version 1.5]

_New Feature: Rawinput recording (Measurement Mode only)_

* In Measurement Mode, you can now speed up initial setup of upper/lower bound estimates using your mouse instead (default hotkey is `[Alt][/]` to toggle recording).
* Record a rotation in-game with slight over- or undershoots, then assign them to lower/upper limits using hotkeys or the new GUI buttons. This gets you straight to the fine-tuning Turn-Repeater stage.

_Enhancement: Convergence Log window during Measurement Mode_

* Graph showing convergence progress of your Turn-Capture function.
* Estimate-adjustment buttons for those who prefer them over hotkeys.
* Button to display the convergence history as a table (in addition to the detailed log file output).

_Usability Change: Default hotkeys of some commands have been changed_
* Turn once: ~~`Alt [`~~ changed to `Alt` `'` (single quote)
* Turn a lot: ~~`Alt ]`~~ cahnged to `Alt` `;`
* Jog right: ~~`Alt '`~~ changed to `Alt` `>`
* Jog left: ~~`Alt ;`~~ changed to `Alt` `<`
