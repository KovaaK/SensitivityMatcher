## Release Notes

[version 1.2] 

_New Feature: Custom keybind and yaw .ini files_

You can customize your own keybind and yaw list by editing the corresponding .ini files located in the executable's directory. Or, enter a custom yaw value and save it to the list by selecting "Save current yaw". \
The two Fornite presets are moved out of hardcoded list into the default .ini file to improve modularity.
